# PET-Bottle-Recycler
This project is meant to automate the teadious PET-bottle -> 3D printer filament recycling process, commonly known as "PET-Pulling," using pulltrusion.

# Background 
I'm personally not very found of single-use plastics, but fell inlove with rapid prototyping the moment I got my first 3D printer. Watching your designs being brought to life in a matter of minutes is highly-fulfilling and an incredible time saver. This fulfilling process became a bit adictive and worriesome however, when all the small amounts of wasted/unusable plastic prints started to stack up in a shoe box. Even though the PLA is "biodegradable" it still takes at least 80 years and perfect soil/environmental conditions for it to go away. Otherwise, if sent to landfil, it still behaves like any other plastic, slowly degrading in a 400 year timeframe. 
A
I thought, what if I made my prototypes fully recyclable instead? 
Print and iterate within a circular economy, knowing the prints were not being totally wasted sitting on a landfill for hundreds of yearsm, waiting for nothing to happen.
